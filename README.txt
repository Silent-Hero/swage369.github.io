A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Swage369/pen/WrPNwb.

 Uses viewport width/height to make a nice article header image effect thingy, bro. Doesn't work on Firefox, you've been warned.

Forked from [Mitch Pruitt](http://codepen.io/mitchdot/)'s Pen [Sooper cool article header image](http://codepen.io/mitchdot/pen/lehuF/).
